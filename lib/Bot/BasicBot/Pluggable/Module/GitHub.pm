=head1 NAME

Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::GitHub - GitHub-related modules for IRC bots running Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of modules for L<Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable> bots, providing useful
GitHub-related functionality.

If your team use GitHub and colloborate on IRC, these may well be of interest to
you.  They're already in use on the L<Dancer> project's IRC channel, and
internally at my workplace, UK2.

Most communication with GitHub uses L<Net::GitHub::V2>, and can use
authentication with an API key for private repositories.


=head1 MODULES

The following modules are included - see the documentation for each for more 
details on how to use them.

=over 4

=item L<Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::GitHub::EasyLinks>

Provide quick URLs to view issues/pull requests etc when someone mentions one -
for example:

  <user> Go have a look at Issue 42
  <bot1> Issue 42 (It doesn't work) https://github.com/....
  <user> I fixed that in 5fcbb01
  <bot1> Commit 5fcbb01 (Retarded logic fail.) - https://github.com/....
 
You can set a default project per-channel, so the above examples will look at
whatever project is set as default for the channel the message was in.
 
You can also explicitly tell it to look at any other GitHub project:
 
  <user> 5fcbb01 @ bigpresh/Bot-BasicBot-Pluggable-Module-GitHub
  <bot1> Commit 5fcbb01 (Retarded logic fail.) - https://github.com/...


=item L<Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::GitHub::PullRequests>

Monitor pull requests for GitHub projects.

Example:

  <@bigpresh> !pr
  < sophie> Open pull requests for sukria/Dancer : 8 pull requests open
            (felixdo:3, perlpilot:1, jamhed:1, dams:1, ambs:1, JTimothyKing:1)

=item L<Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::GitHub::Announce>

Announces issues raised/closed for each channel's default project.

Periodically checks on issues for each project, and reports changes, for
example:

  < sophie> Issues closed : 667 (YAML::XS for Session::YAML) by jamhed :
            https://github.com/sukria/Dancer/issues/667

=head1 Loading modules

See the L<Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable> documentation for how to load these modules
into your bot.

Do not load this module directly; load the modules named above individually, to
get just the functionality you require.

This module is intended only to provide a base for the other modules, including
shared functionality and common documentation.


=head1 Configuring the default project repo

The modules above need to know what GitHub project repository they should refer
to.

The project (and, optionally, authentication details, if it's not a public
project) are configured with the C<!setgithubproject> command in a private
message to the bot.

You'll need to be authenticated to the bot in order to set the project
(see L<the auth module|Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Auth>).

You set the project with:

  !setgithubproject #channel user/projectname

That sets the default project repo to C<projectname> owned by C<user> on GitHub
(in other words, <https://github.com/user/projectname>).

If the project is a private repository which requires authentication, you can
also tell the bot what user and token it should use to authenticate:

  !setgithubproject #channel user/privateproject someuser:githubtokenhere

You can generate/find an API token for your GitHub account at
L<https://github.com/account/admin>
